# Module 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

<details>
<summary>üéØQ. What is machine learning?</summary>

- Machine Learning is the `science (and art) of programming computers` so they can learn from data.
- Machine learning is the field that gives abilities to computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. - Arthur Samuel (1959)
- ‚≠ê‚≠êMachine learning‚≠ê and ‚≠êdeep learning‚≠ê are fields aimed at `implementing algorithms` that enable computers to learn from data and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.‚≠ê
- There are below main types of machine learning:
  - Supervised Learning
  - Unsupervised Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning
- Each type has its own unique characteristics and applications.

<summary>üéØQ. What is supervised learning in ML? Different types (3 key types)</summary>

- `supervised learning` is an algorithm which maps input X to output Y, where the learning algorithm learns from the "right answers" (labeled data).
- `Supervised learning` is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label.

- `Two main types of Supervised Learning` - 
  - `Regression` - Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices, stock prices).
  - `Classification` - Predicting discrete labels or categories (e.g., spam detection, image recognition).

‚≠ê‚≠ê Regression supervised learnning ‚≠ê‚≠ê
- `Regression meaning` - Its finding the relationship which explains how one element depends on another. 
  - `Regression` also means trying to `predict a number` from infinitely `possible outputs`.
  - `Example` - Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, number of rooms, etc.
  - In advertising, it's used... given input features of user, ad, context, predict click through rate (CTR)


‚≠ê‚≠ê Classification supervised learning ‚≠ê‚≠ê
- `Classification meaning` - Its finding the relationship which explains how one element belongs to a particular category or class.
  - `Classification` also means trying to `predict a label` from a `finite set of possible outputs`.
  - `Example` - Email spam detection (spam or not spam), image recognition (cat, dog, car, etc.)
  - In advertising, it's used... given input features of user, ad, context, predict whether user will click on the ad (yes/no)

- NOTESSS- 
- üí° Its not always finding the straight line in supervised learning regression; this can be polynomial, logarithmic, exponential, etc.
- Classification algorithms predicts categories / classes / labels unlike regression which predicts continuous values( e.g., real numbers).
